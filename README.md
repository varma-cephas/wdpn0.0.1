## The script needs the following installed dependencies to run properly
- Python
- Node
- Npm
- VS Code

## Getting started
- To get started, please clone the repository and move the script file into a directory where you store all your project, like Documents for example.
## To run the script, please use as an example:
    py main.py directory_name

## Todo
    [ ] Install script globally to be ran from any directory

### Please note that I'm currently looking for a solution to install the script globally. In the meantime you can run the script by running the script file in a directory where you store all your projects.

## Any feedback or improvement tip is highly welcomed. Thank you!
