## The script needs the following installed dependencies to run properly
- Python
- Node
- Npm
- VS Code

## Getting started
- To get started, please clone the repository and move the script file into a directory where you store all your project, like Documents for example.
## To run the script, please use as an example:
    py main.py directory_name

## Todo
    [ ] Install script globally so that it's possible to be ran from any directory

### Please note that I'm currently looking for a solution to install the script globally. In the meantime you can use the script by running the script file in a directory where you store all your projects.
    The following script was written in a Windows environment, so if the `path` or  `directories` doesn't work for you, please tweak them to your OS. Thank you! 

## Any feedback, questions or improvement tips are highly welcomed. Thank you!
